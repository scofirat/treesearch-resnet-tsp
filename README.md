# treesearch-resnet-tsp
A Residual Neural Network for solving a modified TSP. Done for [this competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths) at Kaggle.com. It scores about 1.8 M after a night in training by generated sequences and, which is significantly worse than the best score, and similar to the competitors who have tried a similar approach. I have personally abandoned this particular approach.

The code should be useful to anyone who wants to set up a residual neural network for simple reinforcement learning problems of extremely long games. The code for a single ResNet block has been borrowed from [suragnair/alpha-zero-general](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general). [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) have also been made use of.
